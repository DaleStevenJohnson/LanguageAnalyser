The MAX Yellow Line is a light rail service in Portland, Oregon, United States, operated by TriMet as part of the MAX Light Rail system. It connects North Portland to Portland City Center and Portland State University. Following years of failed attempts to construct the South/North Line between Clackamas County and Clark County, Washington, Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension from the city center to North Portland in 1999. The line began construction in 2001 and opened on May 1, 2004. As a source of funding, the city created an urban renewal area, which has been blamed for gentrifying historically black inner-city neighborhoods; about 10,000 people of color left Portland's Central City between 2000 and 2010. The line serves 17 stops and runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum headway of 15 minutes during most of the day.
